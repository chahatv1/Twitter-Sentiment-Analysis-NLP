# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP

This project aims to analyze and classify the sentiment of tweets related to specific topics or keywords. The project involves several steps, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The primary goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sentiment of new, unseen tweets.

## Introduction

Social media platforms, especially Twitter, have become a major source of user-generated content where people express their opinions on various topics. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words, and it can provide valuable insights into public opinion and trends. This project demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data.

## Features

- Collect tweets using the Twitter API.
- Preprocess tweets to remove noise and irrelevant content.
- Implement a variety of machine learning models for sentiment classification.
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.
- Visualize the results with charts and graphs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Twitter API credentials by creating a `config.py` file:

   ```python
   CONSUMER_KEY = 'your-consumer-key'
   CONSUMER_SECRET = 'your-consumer-secret'
   ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your-access-token'
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'your-access-token-secret'
   ```

## Usage

1. **Collect Data**: Run the script to collect tweets related to specific keywords or hashtags:

   ```bash
   python collect_tweets.py --keywords "keyword1, keyword2"
   ```

2. **Preprocess Data**: Clean and preprocess the collected tweets:

   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py --input data/raw_tweets.csv --output data/cleaned_tweets.csv
   ```

3. **Train Model**: Train the sentiment analysis model:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py --input data/cleaned_tweets.csv
   ```

4. **Evaluate Model**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model:

   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py --model models/sentiment_model.pkl --input data/test_tweets.csv
   ```

5. **Visualize Results**: Generate visualizations for the analysis:

   ```bash
   python visualize_results.py --model models/sentiment_model.pkl --input data/cleaned_tweets.csv
   ```

## Data Collection

Tweets are collected using the Twitter API. You will need to set up a Twitter developer account and create an application to obtain the necessary credentials. The `collect_tweets.py` script allows you to specify keywords or hashtags to filter the tweets.

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing step involves:

- Removing HTML tags, special characters, and URLs.
- Tokenizing and stemming the text.
- Converting text to lowercase and removing stop words.
- Creating a clean dataset ready for model training.

## Model Training

Several machine learning models are implemented, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM

Each model is trained on the preprocessed data, and hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize performance.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation is performed to ensure the robustness of the models. The results are compared to identify the best-performing model.

## Results

The project includes visualizations of the model performance and sentiment distribution across different topics. Key findings and insights are highlighted in the `results` directory.
